# Epidemiological thresholds in closed populations
## Supplementary File 

The following R code walks through the determination of epidemiologic thresholds for monitoring of mortality following climate disasters, with particular applications to closed populations. Data come from the [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/) and the method can be applied to other instances where monthly counts are collected. 

This is the method applied by Santos and Howard (2018) in their recent publication [Use of Death Counts From Vital Statistics to Calculate Excess Deaths in Puerto Rico Following Hurricane Maria](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2696479).

This method is consistent with epidemiological monitoring systems used for influenza and pneumonia around the world. The added benefit is the reduced number of assumption that underlies the
